## Concurrent Signal Assignment
signal name <= projected-waveform
closed feedback loop: `q <= (q and (not en)) or (d and en);`
## Conditional Signal Assignment
```vhdl
signal-name <= value-expr-1 when boolean-expr-1 else
               value-expr-2 when boolean-expr-2 else
               value-expr-n;

x <= a when (s="00") else
     ...;
```
## Sequential Statements
```vhdl
Process (sensitivity-list)
  begin
     declarations;
     Sequential statement ;
     Sequential statement ; . . .
  end process;
```
### wait 
- wait on signal
- wait until boolean-equation
- wait for time-expression
```vhdl
process
   begin
      y <= a and b and c;
      wait on a, b, c;
    end process;
```
### sequential signal assignment

### variable assignment
```vhdl
signal a, b, y: std-logic;
process (a, b)
  begin
     variable tmp : std-logic ;
     tmp := '0';
     tmp := tmp or a;
     tmp := trnp or b;
     y <= tmp;
end process;
```

### if
```vhdl
if boolean_expr_1 then
   seq_statements;
elsif expr_2 then
   swq_statements;
...
else 
   seq_statements;
end if;
```

```vhdl
architecture if_arch of mux4 is
begin
   process(a,b,c,d,s)
   begin
      if (s="00") then 
         x <= a;
      elsif (s="01") then
         x <= b;
      elsif (s="10") then
         x <= c;
      else 
         x <= d;
      end if;
   end process;
end if_arch;
```
### case
General Case
```vhdl
case case_expression is 
   when choice_1 =>
      seq_statements;
   when ..... =>
	   ...;
end case;
```
Sample
```vhdl
architecture case_arch of mux4 is
begin
   process(a,b,c,d,s)
   begin
      case s is
         when "00" =>
            x <= a;
         when "01" =>
            x <= b;
         when "10" =>
            x <= c;
         when others =>
            x <= d;
     end case;
     
```
### for loop (simple)
```vhdl
for index in loop_range loop
   sequential statements;
end loop;
```
## Register
```vhdl
module D_FF

```
## FSM
