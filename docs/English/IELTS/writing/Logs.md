## C9-T1-1 Map Comparison
The map illustrates the changes caused by the construction of some tourist facilities.
Before the construction, there was only an undeveloped beach and some trees on the thin island surrounded by the sea, which is about 250 meters in length. There are no seaports on the island and no bridges connected to it so it is hard to get access to.
After the development, the reception building was situated close to the center of the island, with a restaurant connected by a vehicle track. Some houses for accommodation were built on both sides of the reception center, each forming a circle of footpath. Next to the left side of the accommodation area, a beach was developed for swimming to provide a water-friendly environment. The pier was constructed for boats and sailings to berthing, making the transportation conditions to the island much more convenient. However, there are still about 20 percent of the land remained undeveloped.
In conclusion, the construction of tourist attractions provides accommodations for tourists and spaces **to relax**, which makes the island more valuable.
